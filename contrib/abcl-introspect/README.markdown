ABCL-INTROSPECT
===============

ABCL-INTROSPECT offers more extensive systems for inspecting the state
of the implementation, most notably in integration with SLIME, where
the backtrace mechanism is augmented to the poiont that local
variables are inspectable.

See <https://github.com/easye/slime/tree/evenson-merge-20170529a> for
the changes to SLIME that were working well at the time of release.
